The main aim of the project is to provide a ML Solution workplace. We are trying to develop a API Service platform for ML/DL operations like Sentiment analysis, Image Captioning, Text Analysis and others.

Every project working with different backend like NodeJs, Java, Kotlin don’t need to change their framework to use Machine learning operations, they just need RESTful API service and that’s all.
